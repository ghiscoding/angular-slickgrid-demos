# Angular-Slickgrid Demos
## Multiple Demos of the [Angular-Slickgrid](https://github.com/ghiscoding/Angular-Slickgrid) library
#### All demos were created using the Angular-CLI

### Installation
Choose the theme and feature you want, they are separated into 2 theme (Bootstrap 3 or 4) and there's a demo with Custom Locales (without `ngx-translate`, fixed Locales) and the other demos are all with `ngx-translate` (dynamically switch language on the fly).

#### VScode
If you use Visual Studio Code, you can also run each of the demo through the multiple VSCode Tasks.

## Bootstrap 3 - with Custom Locales (single locale)
This is the same as the Bootstrap 3 demo except that it uses custom Locale(s) and does not require (neither use) `ngx-translate` and are with fixed Locale(s) (this means you cannot switch locale on the fly). The Locales that were added for the demo (English/French), can be found under [src/app/locales](/bootstrap3-demo-with-locales/src/app/locales). You can use, and define, your own custom Locales via a TypeScript file.
